	// ALTERNATIVE METAL
	'definicion_alternative-metal' => 'Alternative metal is a style of heavy metal.
		Alternative metal usually takes elements of heavy metal with influences from parent-genre
		alternative rock, and other genres not normally associated with metal.Alternative metal
		bands are often characterized by heavy guitar riffs, melodic vocals, unconventional
		sounds within other heavy metal genres, unconventional song structures and
		sometimes experimental approaches to heavy music. The term has been in usage
		since the 1980s, although it came into prominence in the 1990s.
		<br>
		It has spawned several subgenres, including nu metal, which expands
		the alternative metal sound, commonly adding influences from hip hop and groove metal.',

	// BLACK METAL
	'definicion_black-metal' => 'Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy
		metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a "shrieking" vocal style, highly distorted
		guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures
		and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in "corpse paint" and adopt pseudonyms.
		<br>
		During the 1980s, several thrash and death metal bands formed a prototype for black metal.
		This so-called "first wave" included bands such as Venom, Mercyful Fate, Bathory,
		Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. A "second wave" arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded
		by Norwegian bands such as Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Immortal and Emperor.
		The early Norwegian black metal scene developed the style of their forebears
		into a distinct genre. Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout
		Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles independently',

	// DEATH METAL
	'definicion_death-metal' => 'Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music.
		It typically employs heavily distorted and down tuned guitars, played with techniques
		such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive,
		powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality,
		abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions.
		The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence,
		Satanism, religion, occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, philosophy,
		science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation,
		dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.
		<br>
		Building from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal
		emerged during the mid-1980s. Bands such as Venom, Slayer, Celtic Frost and Kreator,
		were important influences on the genre\'s creation. Possessed and Death, along with
		bands such as Obituary, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, and Morbid Angel, are often
		considered pioneers of the genre. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal
		gained more media attention as popular genre niche record labels like Combat, Earache,
		and Roadrunner, began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate.',

	// MELODIC DEATH
	'definicion_melodic-death' => 'Melodic death metal (also referred to as melodeath) is an extreme
		subgenre of heavy metal music that combines elements from the New Wave of British
		Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) with elements of death metal. The style originated and
		developed in Sweden (pioneered by At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity and In Flames)
		and the United Kingdom (pioneered by Carcass) during the early and mid-1990s.
		The Swedish death metal scene did much to popularize the style, which soon centered
		in the "Gothenburg metal" scene in Gothenburg, Sweden.',

	// FOLK METAL
	'definicion_folk-metal' => 'Folk metal is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that developed
		in Europe during the 1990s, a fusion of heavy metal and traditional folk music.
		This includes the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent,
		traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech).
		<br>
		The earliest folk metal band was Skyclad from England. Their debut album The Wayward
		Sons of Mother Earth was released in 1990. It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other
		early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe
		as well as in Israel. Among these early groups, the Irish band Cruachan and the
		German band Subway to Sally each spearheaded a different regional variation
		that over time became known as Celtic metal and medieval metal respectively.
		Despite their contributions, folk metal remained little known with few representatives
		during the 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence,
		particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani,
		Turisas, and Moonsorrow.',

	// GOTHIC METAL
	'definicion_gothic-metal' => 'Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a subgenre of heavy metal and
		gothic rock that combines the heaviness of doom metal or death-doom with the dark atmospheres
		of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic
		approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s
		in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal.
		Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as
		personal experiences.',

	// GROOVE METAL
	'definicion_groove-metal' => 'Groove metal (sometimes called post-thrash, neo-thrash, power groove
		or simply groove) is a subgenre of heavy metal music. It is often used to describe Pantera
		and Exhorder. At its core, groove metal takes the intensity and sonic qualities of
		thrash metal and plays it at a mid-tempo, with most bands making only occasional
		forays into fast tempo.',

	// HEAVY METAL
	'definicion_heavy-metal' => 'Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that
		developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States.
		With roots in blues rock and psychedelic rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed
		a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos,
		emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are
		often associated with masculinity, aggression, and machismo.
		<br>
		The first heavy metal bands such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath attracted
		large audiences, though they were often derided by critics, a status common throughout
		the history of the genre. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre\'s
		evolution by discarding much of its blues influence; Motörhead introduced a
		punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Bands in the New Wave of
		British Heavy Metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. Before
		the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as "metalheads" or "headbangers". ',

	// INDUSTRIAL METAL
	'definicion_industrial-metal' => 'Industrial metal is a musical genre that draws from
		industrial dance music, thrash metal and hardcore punk, using repeating metal
		guitar riffs, sampling, synthesizer or sequencer lines, and distorted vocals.
		Founding industrial metal acts include Ministry, Godflesh, and KMFDM. Industrial metal
		is most well known in its various European permutations. Industrial metal groups
		have produced many acclaimed music videos.
		<br>
		Industrial metal developed in the late 1980s, as industrial and heavy metal began
		to fuse into a common genre. In the early years of the 21st century,
		groups from the black metal scene began to incorporate elements of
		industrial music. Industrial metal did well in the early 1990s, particularly
		in North America, with the success of groups such as Nine Inch Nails.
		The Industrial metal movement began to fade in the latter half of the 1990.',

	// NU METAL
	'definicion_nu-metal' => 'Nu metal (also known as new metal, neo-metal, nü-metal, or aggro-metal)
		is a fusion genre of heavy metal that combines elements of metal music with elements of
		multiple genres, most notably genres like hip hop, funk, and grunge. It is part of the
		alternative metal genre.
		<br>
		Bands associated with nu metal have derived influence from a variety of diverse styles,
		including multiple sub-genres of heavy metal. Nu metal music is largely syncopated
		and based on guitar riffs, although guitar solos are rare. Many nu metal bands
		use seven-string guitars to create a heavier sound. DJs are also sometimes used for
		 scratching and electronic backgrounds. Nu metal vocal styles range between singing,
		rapping, screaming and death growling.',

	// POWER METAL
	'definicion_power-metal' => 'Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal
		with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized
		by a more uplifting sound, in contrast to the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in
		styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like
		songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical,
		dramatic and emotionally "powerful" sound. The term was first used in the middle of
		the \'80s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and
		largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a
		later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Germany, Greece,
		Finland, Italy and Scandinavia), Latin America (Argentina, Brazil) and Japan, with a
		lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.',

	// PROGRESSIVE METAL
	'definicion_progressive-metal' => 'Progressive metal (sometimes known as prog metal or prog-metal)
		is a subgenre of both progressive rock and heavy metal, originating in the United Kingdom
		and the United States In the 1970s. Progressive metal blended elements of heavy metal and
		progressive rock music, taking the loud "aggression" and amplified electric guitar-driven
		sound of the former, with the more experimental, complex and "pseudo-classical"
		compositions of the latter. Progressive metal often utilises the conceptual themes
		associated with progressive rock. Throughout the years, progressive metal has borrowed
		influences from several other genres, including classical and jazz fusion music.
		<br>
		Whilst the genre emerged towards the late-1980s, it was not until the 1990s that progressive
		metal achieved commercial success. Dream Theater, Queensrÿche, Tool and Fates
		Warning are a few examples of progressive metal bands who achieved commercial success;
		additionally, heavy metal bands such as Metallica incorporated elements of progressive music
		in their work. Progressive metal\'s popularity started to decline towards the end of
		the 1990s, but it remains a largely underground genre with a committed fan base.',

	// THRASH METAL
	'definicion_thrash-metal' => 'Thrash metal is a sub-genre of heavy metal music characterized
		by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and
		low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often
		deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory
		language, an approach which partially overlaps with the hardcore genre.
		<br>
		The genre evolved in the early 1980s from combining the drum beats of hardcore punk with
		the guitar style of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. It emerged partially as a reaction
		to the more conventional and widely acceptable glam metal, a less aggressive,
		pop music-infused heavy metal subgenre which appeared simultaneously. Thrash metal was
		an inspiration for subsequent extreme genres such as death metal and black metal.
		<br>
		Four American bands, Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer, are credited with pioneering
		and popularizing the genre. The Clash of the Titans tour (1990–1991), which featured Megadeth,
		Slayer, and Anthrax, is considered the genre\'s pinnacle, after which thrash metal
		saw a decline in popularity throughout the decade. Thrash metal has seen a resurgence
		in recent times, with many of the older bands returning to their roots with their new
		releases. A new generation of thrash metal bands emerged in the early 2000s, drawing
		lyrical and visual inspiration from the older groups.',

	// TECHNICAL DEATH
	'definicion_technical-death' => 'Technical death metal (sometimes called tech-death or
		progressive death metal)[dubious – discuss][dubious – discuss] is a musical subgenre
		of death metal that focuses on complex rhythms, riffs and song structures.
		<br>
		Technical experimentation in death metal began in the late 1980s and early 1990s by bands
		such as Death, Atheist and Cynic. In 1990, Nocturnus released their debut album,
		The Key, which was followed by Sarcófago\'s third album, The Laws of Scourge, featuring a
		change in their musical style from black metal/thrash metal to technical death metal.
		Atheist\'s second album, Unquestionable Presence, Pestilence\'s third album, Testimony
		of the Ancients, and Death\'s fourth album, Human, were all released the very next year.
		Human and later Death albums have proven especially influential on later \'90s technical
		death metal bands. In 1991, New York\'s grindcore-influenced Suffocation released
		the Effigy of the Forgotten debut album, which focused on speed and brutality with
		"sophisticated" sense of songwriting and subsequently became groundbreaking in the genre.
		<br>
		Phil Freeman, ex-editor of Metal Edge, has described the sub-genre of technical death metal as
		"the hidden side of its genre, having more in common with prog-rock and jazz fusion than
		with the mechanistic, Satan-obsessed grinding that\'s the music\'s dominant public image."',

	// DEATHCORE
	'definicion_deathcore' => 'Deathcore is a genre of extreme metal that combines sounds
		and characteristics of death metal with sounds and characteristics of metalcore.
		It is defined by death metal riffs, blast beats and use of metalcore breakdowns.
		Deathcore seems to have most prominence within the southwestern United States, especially
		Arizona and inland southern California (mostly the Coachella Valley), which are home to
		many notable bands and various festivals',

	// DJENT
	'definicion_djent' => 'Djent /ˈdʒɛnt/ is a style of heavy metal music that developed as
		a spinoff of traditional progressive metal. The word "djent" is an onomatopoeia
		for the distinctive high-gain, distorted palm-muted guitar sound most notably
		employed by bands like Meshuggah and Sikth. The term was initially coined by
		Meshuggah lead guitarist, Fredrik Thordendal. Typically, the word is used to refer
		to music that makes use of this sound, to the sound itself, or to the
		scene that revolves around it.',

	// HARDCORE
	'definicion_hardcore' => 'Hardcore punk (usually referred to simply as hardcore) is a punk
		rock music genre and subculture that originated in the late 1970s. Hardcore music is generally
		faster, heavier, and more abrasive than regular punk rock. The origin of the term "hardcore punk"
		is uncertain. The Vancouver-based band D.O.A. may have helped to popularize the term with the
		title of their 1981 album, Hardcore \'81. Hardcore historian Steven Blush said that
		the term "hardcore" is also a reference to the sense of being "fed up" with the
		existing punk and new wave music. Blush also states that the term refers to
		"an extreme: the absolute most Punk." One definition of the genre is "a form
		of exceptionally harsh punk rock."',

	// METALCORE
	'definicion_metalcore' => 'Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk.
		The name is an amalgam of the names of the two genres, distinguished by its emphasis on breakdowns,
		 which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering bands,
		such as— Hogan\'s Heroes, Earth Crisis, and Integrity, —are described to lean more toward
		hardcore punk, whereas latter bands—Killswitch Engage, Bury Tomorrow, Underoath,
		All That Remains, Trivium, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and
		The Devil Wears Prada —are described to lean more towards metal. Sepultura, who has
		been credited as "helped to lay the groundwork" in the 2000s, and Pantera, who
		influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth, have also been influential in
		the 2000s, and the further development of metalcore.',

	// POST HARDCORE
	'definicion_post-hardcore' => 'Post-hardcore is a genre of music that is derived from and has
		origins in the hardcore punk music genre, itself an offshoot of the broader punk rock movement.
		Like post-punk, post-hardcore is a term for a broad constellation of groups. Many emerged from
		the hardcore punk scene, or took inspiration from hardcore, while concerning themselves with a wider
		degree of expression.
		<br>
		The genre took shape in the mid-to-late-1980s with releases from bands from cities that had
		established hardcore punk scenes, in particular from the scenes in Washington, D.C. such as
		Fugazi as well as slightly different sounding groups such as Big Black and Jawbox
		that stuck closer to the noise rock roots of post-hardcore',

	// TRANCECORE
	'definicion_trancecore' => 'Trancecore & Electronicore (also known as synthcore, or simply electronic
		hardcore) describes a stylistic fusion of post-hardcore and metalcore with electronic music,
